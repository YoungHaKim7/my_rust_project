# Here is an example of a simple machine learning program written in the Rust programming language:

This program sets up a game context and creates a new MainState struct to hold the game's state. It then runs the game loop, which handles events and updates the game state accordingly. The MainState struct and its associated methods and the event handling methods can be customized to implement the specific game logic and mechanics.








```

use ndarray::{Array, Array2};
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use rusty_machine::linalg::{Matrix, Vector};
use rusty_machine::learning::k_means::KMeansClassifier;
use rusty_machine::learning::UnSupModel;

// Create some random data to cluster
let mut rng = thread_rng();
let data: Vec<Vector<f64>> = (0..100)
    .map(|_| Vector::new(vec![rng.gen(), rng.gen()]))
    .collect();
let data = Matrix::new(100, 2, data);

// Create a new k-means model with 2 clusters
let mut model = KMeansClassifier::new(2);

// Train the model on the data
model.train(&data)?;

// Predict the cluster assignments for the data
let assignments = model.predict(&data)?;

// Print the cluster assignments
println!("Cluster assignments: {:?}", assignments);
This program creates some random data and uses the KMeansClassifier type from the rusty_machine crate to train a k-means clustering model on the data. It then uses the trained model to predict the cluster assignments for the data and prints the results. The KMeansClassifier type and the train and predict methods can be customized to implement different machine learning algorithms and apply them to different types of data.
