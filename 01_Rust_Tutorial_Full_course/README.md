- Rust Programmers, if the Rust commuity wants to hide horrors, fight to prevent a major catastrophe, and unite humanity so we don't have to feel pain or be alone, that's not language evangelism. That's language evangelionism.

# Befor we get stated... Some tips | Ryan Levick

  - Computers are not magic
 
  - All of this is understandable
 
  - Everything you see here was made by humans
 
  - It's all a mix of deliberate choice & choice & random circumstance
 
  - At any given point, it's not always easy to tell which ?
 
  - Unfortunately, explanations are not always the best
 
  - 컴퓨터는 마법이 아니다
 
  - 이 모든 것은 이해할 수 있다
 
  - 여기 보이는 모든 것은 인간이 만든 것이다
 
  - 그것은 모두 의도적인 선택과 선택 그리고 무작위적인 상황의 혼합이다
 
  - 어느 시점에서든 어느 것이 항상 구별하기 쉽지는 않다?
 
  - 불행하게도, 설명이 항상 최선은 아니다

# Presentation by Rust

Rust is a system programming language, compiled and multi-paradigm. It is a cross between imperative language (C), object (C++), functional (Ocaml) and competitor (Erlang). It draws on the theories of the languages of recent years and the most popular programming languages in order to achieve three objectives: speed, security (in particular memory) and competitor (secure data sharing between tasks).

Rust's development was initiated by Graydon Hoare in 2006, particularly in order to resolve security flaws in Firefox without negatively impacting performance. To follow this tutorial, it is highly recommended that I have already developed in at least one other language (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.) because I will only briefly go through the basics. Its strengths are:

Managing ownership of variables
Memory management
Static typing
Type inference
Pattern matching filtering
Genericity
We'll review all of this in more detail. Some useful links:

- Website: rust-lang.org

- The documentation (always useful to have it on hand!)

- Github repository (to view source code)

- The rustbook (the official "course" in English)

- <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/">Rustlings (a program of interactive exercises to accompany learning)</a>

-rust by example (A compilation of rust examples)

- Reddit (to ask a question)
