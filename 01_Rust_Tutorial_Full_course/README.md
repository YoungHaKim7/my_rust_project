# Presentation by Rust

Rust is a system programming language, compiled and multi-paradigm. It is a cross between imperative language (C), object (C++), functional (Ocaml) and competitor (Erlang). It draws on the theories of the languages of recent years and the most popular programming languages in order to achieve three objectives: speed, security (in particular memory) and competitor (secure data sharing between tasks).

Rust's development was initiated by Graydon Hoare in 2006, particularly in order to resolve security flaws in Firefox without negatively impacting performance. To follow this tutorial, it is highly recommended that I have already developed in at least one other language (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.) because I will only briefly go through the basics. Its strengths are:

Managing ownership of variables
Memory management
Static typing
Type inference
Pattern matching filtering
Genericity
We'll review all of this in more detail. Some useful links:
