I’m doing all of my work on this in the open, in my simonw/advent-of-code-2022-in-rust repository on GitHub. Each day gets an issue, and I’m making notes on the help I get from the AI tools in detailed issue comments.

Here are my issue threads so far:

Day 1: Calorie Counting
Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors
Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization
Day 4: Camp Cleanup
Day 5: Supply Stacks
Day 6: Tuning Trouble
I recommend checking out each issue in full if you want to follow how this has all been going.
